      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, we focus on the pollutions near major sources over western Taiwan.
Aircraft-based observation data are analyzed and compared with surface measurements and model
results to investigate near surface chemical reactions of pollutants.
The result will be presented in 18th ACC in Taipei in Dec. 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
